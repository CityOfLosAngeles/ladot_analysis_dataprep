## Slope Computations

### Examples
The following images show the LA county OSM roads colored from green to red based on the percentage of each OSM way that has a slope >= 6%:

1. This county-wide map shows roads with the highest percentage of slopes >6% clustered around the the foothills of the Santa Monica and San Gabriel mountain ranges, as expected:![](https://github.com/RSGInc/ladot_analysis_dataprep/blob/master/la_slopes.png)

2. A more detailed view shows the severity of the slopes of streets leading down to sea level near Manhattan Beach:![](https://github.com/RSGInc/ladot_analysis_dataprep/blob/master/manhattan_beach.png)

3. A third image highlights the slopes of roads to the north west of Dodger Stadium including the infamously inclined [Baxter Street](https://www.laweekly.com/this-super-steep-echo-park-street-is-hell-on-earth-for-cars/):
